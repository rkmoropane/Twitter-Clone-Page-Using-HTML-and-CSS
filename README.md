# Project Simulation - Solo Twitter Project

I learnt to code the entire twitter clone, by being part of a virtual team, working with a virtual project manager. 
I also get assistance from instructors when stuck with something. 
I learnt some basic project management, and learn key skills that employers look for, and 
I built my own portfolio of practical experience.

## What is Project Management

- Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve all project goals within the given constraints.

- What you want to achieve, how you are going to achieve it, and how long its going to take.

- Everyone involved shares a similar objective and understands how to achieve this goal, and what their role is in achieving the goal

- Not just a to do list, takes into account good planning, communication, management, carefully choreographed sequence of events, where risks are considered.

- For a successful project, we need the right skills and knowledge.


## Our First Stand-up:
- Initialize the GitHub Repo.

- CI/CD deployment.
